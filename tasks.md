## Task 1
- Explore the features of the application (make simple sounds like DoReMi)

## Task 2
- Recreate part of song with visual assistance (Only rRhythms no pitch yet ) - For this task we will be giving the child this simple rhythm as seen in Figure 1, for this specific task there will be no pitch present and all beats will be set in C. We will let the child listen to the song during this task. We will also give the children a visual representation on top of the actual music sheet, a preview of this can be seen in figure 2. The rest of the visual representation and the song can be seen and accessed on the site.

## Task 3
- Recreate part of Ssong with assistance (rhythms with pitch already)  For this task we will be giving the child this simple song called “Bells in the Snow” with repeating sections as seen in Figure 3, for this specific task same as Task # 2. This task will require the child to explore more features of the application due to pitch being added and more sections of the songs can be seen. We will let the child listen to the song during this task. We will also give the children a visual representation on top of the actual music sheet this time with the different pitch, a preview of this can be seen in figure 4. The rest of the visual representation and the song can be seen and accessed on the site.

## Task 4
- Recreate part of Song without the assistance of a music sheet (London Bridge is Falling Down) - For this task we will let the child compose a short and very familiar song which is London Bridge is Falling Down, for this task we will be requiring the child to create the same song with them just listening to it. The song can be heard from and accessed on the site.

## Task 5
- Recreate part of Song with only a music sheet (Twinkle, twinkle, little stars) - For the last task, the child will be asked to compose the song using both the music sheet and listening to the song. The difference of this task to those of task 2 and 3 is that there is no more visual assistance of the firefly to the child, as they will be using the music sheet provided and the song to compose the music sheet can be seen below in Figure 5. The song can be heard from and accessed on the site.
