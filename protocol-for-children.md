## Overview and Objectives
- We are currently in our phase 3 of our research framework wherein we have already made 3 iterations of the application and in this iteration we would want to test the learning of the child when the application is used over the course of 5 days.
- For this iteration of testing we plan to test at least 12 children using the application, and to also have 6 music experts to evaluate them in the progression of their learning. For the participants it would consist of children aged 5-8, ideally we would like to have an equal split between children that enroll in a music school/have experience and also those that are not experienced in music. We would also want a balance between the genders of the participants and a variety in their age.
- We would explain before testing the order in which the children would do their tasks and we would randomize the order of the tasks per participant. We would ask for the help of the parents (if possible) to help in supervising the child so that the order of the tasks will be followed for each participant.
- After testing we would also be explaining to the music experts the sequence in which the tasks were done for them to gauge if there was an improvement in the compositions that were made by the kids.
- For the tasks we would design them for the child to have an audio output that will eventually be given to the music experts for evaluation. We would also explain this more in depth during the online call between us and the children with their parents. For this we will design in the homepage of the application the 5 different tasks for them to do and selecting it would lead to a new environment where they would do their respective tasks. Please refer to the [tasks] ({% link tasks.md %}) page to see detailed tasks.
